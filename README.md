Note on Formatting and Template Customization
Although this report uses the elegantpaper class as the base template for PDF output, 
several formatting elements have been customized. These include modifications to 
section heading styles (such as colors and spacing), the use of the TeX Gyre Pagella font 
for improved typographic readability, and adjustments to title page layout, table appearance, 
and cross-reference styling. These changes were made to enhance clarity and 
presentation quality while maintaining full reproducibility of the report.

The customized LaTeX template files, including elegantpaper.cls and elegantpaper-pandoc.tex, 
are stored in the tex/ directory of the project repository. These modifications 
are made in accordance with the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL v1.3c), 
which explicitly permits the creation and distribution of derived works, 
provided that proper attribution and modification disclosure are maintained.

This report uses the TeX Gyre Pagella font for improved typographic quality. 
To reproduce the appearance of the PDF, install the tex-gyre package 
(e.g., using “ tinytex::tlmgr_install("tex-gyre")” in R) and 
ensure the document is compiled using the xelatex engine.
