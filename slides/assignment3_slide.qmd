# Does Income Deprivation Affect Educational Attainment?

### Vicky Feng & Ruyu Li & Dev Karan Gur

---

## Introduction
- Regional inequality in education is a persistent concern in England.
- This study examines whether town-level income deprivation influences academic attainment for youth aged 18 to 22.
- We focus on three key outcome stages:
  - Level 3 qualification at age 18
  - University entry at age 19
  - Level 6+ qualification by age 22
- Goal: Assess how income inequality impacts educational outcomes and whether effects differ by town size.

## Research Question

**Does the income level of a town affect the educational outcomes of young people?**
---

## Variables and Dataset Description

- Based on `english_education.csv` from the TidyTuesday project.
- Contains 1104 town-level observations and 31 variables.
- Key variables used:
  - `income_flag`: income deprivation group (higher/mid/lower)
  - `level3_at_18`, `uni_at_19`, `level6_at_22`: educational outcomes
  - `size_flag`: town size classification (small/medium/large)
- Enables exploration of how deprivation and town size relate to long-term educational attainment.

## results

- Educational attainment rises as income deprivation decreases.
- Lower deprivation towns outperform others at ages 18, 19, and 22.
- The gap is most pronounced in small towns, especially at Level 6+.
- Highlights the role of local economic conditions.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- Strong link: less deprived towns show better educational outcomes.
- Support should target high-deprivation towns ‚Äî especially small ones.
- Recommend expanding dataset and integrating qualitative factors.
