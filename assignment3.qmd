# Executive summary

This report investigates how town-level income deprivation affects educational attainment among English youth aged 18 to 22. Using national data, we analyze academic outcomes at three life stages: Level 3 qualification at 18, university entry at 19, and Level 6+ attainment by 22. Results show a clear upward trendâ€”youth from lower deprivation towns consistently outperform those from higher deprivation areas, especially by age 22. These findings highlight structural inequalities and suggest the need for targeted educational support in deprived communities.

# Introduction

Regional inequality in education remains a pressing issue in England, particularly among young people transitioning from secondary to higher education. This study examines whether income deprivation at the town level impacts academic outcomes for individuals aged 18 to 22. We focus on three key milestones: Level 3 qualifications at age 18, full-time university participation at age 19, and Level 6 or higher qualification by age 22. These stages reflect national benchmarks for educational progression.

To maintain analytical consistency, cities are excluded due to their distinctive socio-demographic structures, such as dense populations and diverse education systems. We also remove entries with missing or unclear income classifications to ensure accurate results. The dataset is grouped by income level and town size, and analyzed using both summary statistics and visualizations. Trends are observed across large, medium, and small towns.

Findings reveal a consistent association: as income deprivation decreases, educational attainment increases. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of structural disadvantage and informs more equitable, evidence-based education policies.

# Research Question

Does the income level of a town affect the educational outcomes of young people?

# Data Loading

We use the english_education.csv dataset from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv), which contains education and deprivation data for over 1,000 English towns. It includes over 1,000 observations at the town level and features variables such as income_flag, level_3_at_age_18 variables and so on.

In this study, our group chose to download the dataset locally rather than relying on an online dataset. This approach improves the reproducibility of the analysis because local data ensures continuous access to a stable version of the data and avoids remote sources updating or deleting the data resulting in different analysis results. Also, local datasets are more stable as they do not rely on a network connection, which avoids interruptions due to application program interface limitations or network problems. It also improves processing speed and supports offline analysis, which is essential for a reliable and efficient research workflow.

```{r data loading}
edu_df <- read.csv("data/english_education.csv")
```

```{r related variables chosen}
selected_vars <- c( 
  "income_flag",
  "level_3_at_age_18",
  "activity_at_age_19_full_time_higher_education",

  "size_flag"
)

edu_df_selected <- edu_df %>%
  select(all_of(selected_vars))

# Methodology

```{r data checkout}
#| label: tbl-proportion_of_income
#| tbl-cap: "Proportion of Each Income Flag Category (Cities Excluded)"

edu_df_selected %>%
  count(income_flag) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Proportion of Each Income Flag Category",
    col.names = c("Income Flag", "Count", "Percentage (%)"),
    digits = 1
  )
```

While reviewing the data (@tbl-proportion_of_income), our group discover that there is **missing data** (`NA` value) in the income categories `income_flag`. In order **not to affect the accuracy of the subsequent analysis**, this missing data will not be included in the analysis. Also, since the sample in `Cities` of `income_flag` is **too small and less representative**, it is removed in the subsequent analysis.

```{r data cleaning}
edu_df_clean <- edu_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(income_flag) & income_flag != "Cities") %>%
  mutate(income_flag = factor(income_flag,
                              levels = c("Higher deprivation towns",
                                         "Mid deprivation towns",
                                         "Lower deprivation towns")))
```

    sd_uni19 = sd(activity_at_age_19_full_time_higher_education, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_level6 = mean(highest_level_qualification_achieved_by_age_22_level_6_or_above, na.rm = TRUE),

  ) %>%

    "Income Group" = income_flag,

@tbl-edu_means_by_income shows that education outcomes improve significantly at all measured stages as income levels rise.

For instance, the mean proportion of individuals achieving Level 3 qualifications by age 18 rises from 41.59% in higher deprivation towns to 57.96% in lower deprivation towns. Similar upward trends are observed for higher education participation at age 19 (27.13% to 40.78%) and for achieving Level 6 qualifications by age 22 (23.99% to 35.68%).

The standard deviations are relatively consistent across groups. This suggests that while variation exists, the overall improvement in outcomes is not due to a small number of high performers.

```

@fig-edu_outcomes_boxplot illustrates a clear upward trend in educational attainment as town income levels increase. In all three stages, young people in lower deprivation towns consistently outperform their peers in higher deprivation towns.

Specifically, the median proportions of youth achieving Level 3 qualifications at age 18, participating in full-time higher education at age 19, and attaining Level 6 qualifications by age 22 are all higher in towns with lower deprivation. The interquartile ranges are also narrower in lower deprivation towns, suggesting more consistent performance within these areas.

In contrast, higher deprivation towns exhibit not only lower median outcomes but also greater variability, as reflected by the wider spread of the boxplots and more outliers.

As shown in Figure @fig-income-education-by-size, educational attainment increases consistently as income deprivation decreases, across all town sizes. Towns with lower deprivation levels demonstrate the highest average proportions of students achieving Level 3 qualifications at age 18, entering university at age 19, and obtaining Level 6 or higher qualifications by age 22.

This pattern holds for large, medium, and small towns, though the gap between high and low deprivation groups appears most pronounced in small towns, particularly at the Level 6+ stage. In small towns, the difference in university attainment between high and low deprivation groups exceeds 10 percentage points.

These results reinforce a strong association between local income levels and youth educational outcomes, and suggest that deprivation may have an even stronger impact in smaller towns.

# Discussion

Our findings demonstrate a clear and consistent pattern: towns with lower income deprivation exhibit significantly better educational outcomes at all three measured stagesâ€”ages 18, 19, and 22. This trend is visible across town sizes, with the disparity being most pronounced in small towns, especially for Level 6 qualifications by age 22. These results align with recent ONS findings, suggesting that lower-deprivation and smaller towns tend to provide more supportive environments for academic progression. The narrower interquartile ranges in these towns further indicate more consistent performance, while higher-deprivation towns show greater variability and more outliers.

# Conclusion

There is a strong and persistent association between local income levels and educational attainment among youth in England. Structural income deprivation appears to limit academic progression, particularly in smaller towns, where the effects are magnified. These patterns highlight the role of place-based disadvantage and point to the need for regional education strategies that directly address income-linked barriers. Interventions must be responsive to both deprivation level and town characteristics to reduce long-term inequalities.

# Recommendations

Increase educational support in high-deprivation areas.

Expand access programs to encourage university progression.

Incorporate income deprivation metrics into education policy and resource allocation.
