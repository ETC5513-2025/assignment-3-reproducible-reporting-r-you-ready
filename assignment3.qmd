# Executive summary

This report investigates how town-level income deprivation affects educational attainment among English youth aged 18 to 22. Using national data, we analyze academic outcomes at three life stages: Level 3 qualification at 18, university entry at 19, and Level 6+ attainment by 22. Results show a clear upward trend—youth from lower deprivation towns consistently outperform those from higher deprivation areas, especially by age 22. These findings highlight structural inequalities and suggest the need for targeted educational support in deprived communities.

# Introduction

Regional inequality in education remains a pressing issue in England, particularly among young people transitioning from secondary to higher education. This study examines whether income deprivation at the town level impacts academic outcomes for individuals aged 18 to 22. We focus on three key milestones: Level 3 qualifications at age 18, full-time university participation at age 19, and Level 6 or higher qualification by age 22. These stages reflect national benchmarks for educational progression.

To maintain analytical consistency, cities are excluded due to their distinctive socio-demographic structures, such as dense populations and diverse education systems. We also remove entries with missing or unclear income classifications to ensure accurate results. The dataset is grouped by income level and town size, and analyzed using both summary statistics and visualizations. Trends are observed across large, medium, and small towns.

Findings reveal a consistent association: as income deprivation decreases, educational attainment increases. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of structural disadvantage and informs more equitable, evidence-based education policies.

# Research Question

Does the income level of a town affect the educational outcomes of young people?

# Data Loading

In this study, our group chose to download the dataset locally rather than relying on an online dataset. This approach improves the reproducibility of the analysis because local data ensures continuous access to a stable version of the data and avoids remote sources updating or deleting the data resulting in different analysis results. Also, local datasets are more stable as they do not rely on a network connection, which avoids interruptions due to application program interface limitations or network problems. It also improves processing speed and supports offline analysis, which is essential for a reliable and efficient research workflow.

# Dataset introduction

We use the english_education.csv dataset from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv), which contains education and deprivation data for over 1,000 English towns. It includes over 1,000 observations at the town level and features variables such as income_flag, level_3_at_age_18 variables and so on. see @tbl-tables, The variables listed here represent a selected subset of those most relevant to our analysis. The dataset is suitable for examining how structural income deprivation may affect academic progression among young people. The original data has been archived in the project repository and here is [the location of the data.](data/english_education.csv)

-   *As shown in @fig-income-education, educational attainment increases consistently as income deprivation decreases. Towns with lower deprivation have the highest average proportions of students who achieved Level 3 qualifications at age 18, entered university at age 19, and obtained Level 6 or higher qualifications by age 22. In contrast, higher deprivation towns show substantially lower attainment at each stage. The difference is most pronounced at the higher education level, where the gap between high and low deprivation towns exceeds 10 percentage points. This indicates a strong association between local income levels and long-term educational outcomes among young people.*

# Discussion

Our findings demonstrate a clear and consistent pattern: towns with lower income deprivation exhibit significantly better educational outcomes at all three measured stages—ages 18, 19, and 22. This trend is visible across town sizes, with the disparity being most pronounced in small towns, especially for Level 6 qualifications by age 22. These results align with recent ONS findings, suggesting that lower-deprivation and smaller towns tend to provide more supportive environments for academic progression. The narrower interquartile ranges in these towns further indicate more consistent performance, while higher-deprivation towns show greater variability and more outliers.

# Conclusion

There is a strong and persistent association between local income levels and educational attainment among youth in England. Structural income deprivation appears to limit academic progression, particularly in smaller towns, where the effects are magnified. These patterns highlight the role of place-based disadvantage and point to the need for regional education strategies that directly address income-linked barriers. Interventions must be responsive to both deprivation level and town characteristics to reduce long-term inequalities.

# Recommendations

Increase educational support in high-deprivation areas.

Expand access programs to encourage university progression.

Incorporate income deprivation metrics into education policy and resource allocation.
